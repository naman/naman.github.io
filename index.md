Hello! I am Naman (he/him), a Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu/). My research combines interdisciplinary perspectives through collaborations with [MadS&P](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/), [Preventing Interpersonal Violence and Overcoming Trauma (PIVOT) Lab](https://pivotlab.psych.wisc.edu/), [Native American Women Thriving through Innovative Violence Prevention and Empowerment (NATIVE) Lab](https://nativelab.wiscweb.wisc.edu) and [Sexual Violence Research Initative (SVRI)](https://crgw.gws.wisc.edu/sexual-violence-research-initiative/). With advise from [Prof. Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/), I am committed to advancing the safety and well-being of the marginalized populations who face gender-based violence (GBV) by amplifying their silenced voices. Rooted in cultural sensitivity, my work empowers survivors by fostering safety, healing, and resilience. Further, I coordinate [Madison Tech Clinic](https://techclinic.cs.wisc.edu/) and lead the outreach program with our rural and indigenous partner organizations in Wisconsin, USA.

Prior to PhD, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, advised by [Kapil Vaswani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/) at [Confidential Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/) and [Technology for Empowerment](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/publications/) group. I worked on a [formally verified boot protocol](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tao), a hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and an [offline streaming platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/blendnet/) for low-income and people with a reduced tech literacy in rural India.

I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I was advised by [Prof. Vinayak Naik](http://vinayaknaik.info/) and [Prof. Sachit Butail](https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml).
